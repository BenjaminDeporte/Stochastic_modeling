# Stochastic_modeling
Stochastic and Bayesian models, toys, etc.

### Some Pyro tutorials
- basic Bayesian linear regression in `TOY_Pyro_Basics.ipynb`
- Bayesian Neural Network regression, with SVI and MCMC : `TOY_Pyro_BNN_regression.ipynb` and `bnn_model.py`
- `TOY_Pyro_Learning_OU.ipynb` : learning an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process with a Pyro model and MCMC sampling
- `TOY_NumPyro_Learning_OU.ipynb` : 
  - learning an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process with a NumPyro model (JAX) and MCMC sampling, seeing the O.U. as a Markov process
  - leraning the O.U. process with NumPyro MCMC sampling, seeing the O.U as a Gaussian Process and infering the covariance
